### Hi there 👋

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently studying as a Data Engineer student in the [Data ScienceTech Institute](https://www.datasciencetech.institute/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and improving in Ruby, Python programming, CI/CD, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Hadoop, RDBMS & NoSQL, Data Anlysis and Machine learning
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any project where I could add value and bring my motivation and proactivity to keep learning and improving
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with topics regarding asynchronous programming with python, to learn nodejs and improve cloud computing knowledge
- 📫 How to reach me: on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/faouzi-braza/)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I was a scientist in Immunology who was jaleous of bioinformatic black witchers ! This pushed me to start learning code and trapped me in this path since :-)
