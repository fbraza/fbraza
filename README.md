## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there ([My CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RnL2i_DTQS4FZNPuXQn_M9BCttacDfpl/view?usp=drive_link))
Iâ€™m Faouzi a developer with the soul of a scientist. My path? Unconventional, by design. Ten years in immunology research taught me how to ask hard questions. Four years in ML and data engineering taught me how to build answers that scale on AWS, on GCP, in production, for real users. A detour in a thin tank exposed me to the world of policy and influence. Iâ€™m now seeking my next software engineering role. I would love to meet inspiring people, learn from them and build products that matters.
